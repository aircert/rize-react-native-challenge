Fetch post from Json endpoint

Build a react-native application which satisfies these criteria:

- One page with two main components
- Top Component:
    - UI is a single button
    - When pressed, the component queries this REST endpoint:
        https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
    - populates a redux store with the results
- Bottom Component:
    - shows the results from the redux store
    - shows the status of the Top Componentâ€™s REST request
